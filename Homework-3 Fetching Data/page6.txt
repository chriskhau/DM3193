The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little
Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?"

"Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"

"At three," said the Wolf.

So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the
Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he
saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into
the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to
roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened
the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.

He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had
been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.

Then the little Pig said, "Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to
the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it,
and rolled down the hill."

Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the
little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.

When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of
water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming
down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the
little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate
him for supper, and lived happy ever after.
